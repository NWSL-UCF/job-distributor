1. speculative differ from the real one cuz it doesn't account for 
    1.1 Failed jobs
    1.2 Timeout error
    1.3 Early termination of machines, means termination before end of the actual experiment
    1.4 Job distribution communication and scheduling overhead isn't accounted 
    
2. Speculative once a machine is provision, it's not released until the end of the exp. 

3. Some of the machines in speculative simulation have no tasks assigned to them because they turned on post completion of the experiment.
