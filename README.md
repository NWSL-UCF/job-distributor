# job-distributor

In our research, we often develop simulations whose outcomes are highly dependent on specific parameter settings. Since it's not always clear which combination will yield the best results, we systematically explore all possible combinations and evaluate them based on objective criteria—such as accuracy, performance, or efficiency.

While this method is comprehensive, it can be extremely time-consuming and computationally demanding, especially if simulations are run one after another. To address this challenge, we leverage parallel processing to significantly accelerate the experimentation process. This is where our job-distributor system comes in—it allows us to run thousands of simulations simultaneously and dynamically scale up or down the number of computing resources based on availability, making large-scale experimentation far more efficient and manageable.
