# job-distributor

In our research, we often develop simulations whose outcomes are highly dependent on specific parameter settings. Since it's not always clear which combination will yield the best results, we systematically explore all possible combinations and evaluate them based on objective criteria—such as accuracy, performance, or efficiency.

While this method is comprehensive, it can be extremely time-consuming and computationally demanding, especially if simulations are run one after another. To address this challenge, we leverage parallel processing to significantly accelerate the experimentation process. This is where our job-distributor system comes in—it allows us to run thousands of simulations simultaneously and dynamically scale up or down the number of computing resources based on availability, making large-scale experimentation far more efficient and manageable.



# Job Distributor

A lightweight job distribution framework designed for running thousands of parameterized simulations in parallel. Ideal for research experiments where results depend on specific parameter combinations, and the goal is to identify the most effective configuration based on an objective metric (e.g., accuracy, performance, efficiency).

## Key Features

- Easily define and generate all combinations of parameters
- Automatically distribute jobs across multiple workers
- Monitor job status and logs
- Scalable: add/remove computing resources on demand
- Lightweight API-based architecture
- Graceful shutdown with automatic cleanup

## Use Case

In many research scenarios, simulations must be run across a wide range of parameter settings to identify the optimal configuration. Doing this sequentially is slow and inefficient. `job-distributor` enables you to run these jobs in parallel across available resources—locally, on clusters, or even across machines—dramatically speeding up experimentation.
